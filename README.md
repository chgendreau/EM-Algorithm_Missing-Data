# EPFL - MATH-517 Fall 2023 - Statistical Computation and Visualization - Main Project

# Performance of the EM algorithm and various imputation methods with different missing data mechanisms

The goal of this project is to study the performance of inference using the Expectation Maximization algorithm and various imputation methods with different missing data mechanisms.

## Installation and Requirements

The requirements are listed in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file. To install them, run the following command in the root directory of the project:

``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the notebooks, first move them in the [source](src) folder. Some deprecated notebooks, need the [library.py](src/notebooks/library.py) file to run.

## Report

The report PDF is available [here](docs/report.pdf) and the HTML version is available [here](docs/report.html).

Note that the rendering of the quarto document [report.qmd](src/report.qmd) requires a large amount of computations and **takes around 180 minutes to render** on our machines.

The image in appendix, concerning the comparison of the various methods for the 3 missing data mechanisms on nearly Gaussian data can be generated by running the [non_gaussian.ipynb](src/notebooks/non_gaussian.ipynb) notebook in the [source](src) folder.

## Usage

Using quarto is a one-liner (`quarto render src --to html` or `quarto render src --to pdf`), but the provided Makefile makes it even easier:

```         
make html
make pdf
make # both pdf and html
```

The resulting webpage is in `docs/index.html`, which can be used directly with Github Pages. The pdf is at `docs/report.pdf`
