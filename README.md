# Performance of the EM algorithm and imputation methods with different missing data mechanisms
Final project of the course MATH-517 Statistical Computation and Visualization (EPFL, Fall 2023).

The goal of this project is to study the performance of inference using the Expectation Maximization algorithm and various imputation methods with different missing data mechanisms.

The report is available [here](docs/report.pdf).

## Installation and Requirements

The requirements are listed in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file. To install them, run the following command in the root directory of the project:

``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the notebooks, first move them in the [source](src) folder. Some deprecated notebooks, need the [library.py](src/notebooks/library.py) file to run.

## Usage

Using quarto is a one-liner (`quarto render src --to html` or `quarto render src --to pdf`), but the provided Makefile makes it even easier:

```         
make html
make pdf
make # both pdf and html
```

The resulting webpage is in `docs/index.html`, which can be used directly with Github Pages. The pdf is at `docs/report.pdf`
